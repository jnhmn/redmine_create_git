# Redmine Create Git plugin

Create and initialize a new Git repository from Redmine within seconds!

*WARNING:* This plugin is quite specific to a certain setup and was not made to work across all kind of implementations

I had to create Git repositories quite often and going to the command line to initialize a repository was time-consuming, this plugin solves this problem.

Compatible with Redmine 3.x on Linux

* 3.1.1 stable
Assumed to work on:
* 3.x.x
* 2.6.x
* 2.5.x
* 2.4.x

## READ FIRST

This plugin is made to work with git SmartHTTP. It is required to have the Redmine.pm installed and configured.
I *STRONGLY* recommend you read carefully the "GIT SMART HTTP SUPPORT" section of http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/repository/entry/trunk/extra/svn/Redmine.pm

The git section in Apache's VirtualHost for Redmine should be as following:
```
    #From the Remine.pm Git Smart Http instructions:
    SetEnv GIT_PROJECT_ROOT /opt/gws/repos/git/
    SetEnv GIT_HTTP_EXPORT_ALL
    ScriptAlias /git/ /usr/lib/git-core/git-http-backend/

    PerlLoadModule Apache::Redmine

    <Location /git>
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all


        AuthType Basic
        AuthName "Git repositories"
        Require valid-user

        PerlAccessHandler Apache::Authn::Redmine::access_handler
        PerlAuthenHandler Apache::Authn::Redmine::authen_handler


        ## for mysql
        RedmineDSN "DBI:mysql:database=redmine;host=localhost"
        RedmineDbUser "redmine"
        RedmineDbPass "<yourpasswordhere>"

        #Enable Git Smart Http
        RedmineGitSmartHttp yes
    </Location>
```

## Known Issues

* Only compatible with Linux *(Tested on Debian/Ubuntu/CentOS)*
* No validation tests on the plugin configuration page input!

## Downloading and installing the plugin

First download the plugin using git, open a terminal in your Redmine installation directory:

<tt>git clone https://github.com/jnhmn/redmine_create_git.git ./plugins/</tt>

The plugin uses the content_for in controllers gem. It's required to run a bundle install command:
<tt>bundle install</tt>

The git configuration fields user.name and user.email must be set globally for the corresponding user.

The installation is now finished and you will be able to use the plugin after you restart your Redmine instance.

No need to migrate the database!

## Configuration

Go to your Redmine plugin configuration page. For example http://redmine.domain.com/settings/plugin/redmine_create_git
Set the path to the repositories. It must be a local path and the user running Redmine on the server must have rw permissions.
You can also configure the URL to integrate with Redmine Checkout Plugin. Tested working with [thorin's fork](https://github.com/thorin/redmine_checkout) (Only fork compatible with Redmine 3.x AFAIK).

## Use

* Go to the Project Settings, Repository tab
* Click *"Quick create [Create Git plugin]"*
* Input a repository identifier
* Click *"Create"*
* Start working with git!
